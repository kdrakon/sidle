**sidle** is a CLI tool that helps with directory and file selection.

For example, instead of
```bash
$ cd ../../../
```

or

```bash
$ cd ..
$ cd ..
$ cd ..
```

you can set up an alias to do this

```bash
$ alias sd='sidle -o /tmp/sidle_path && cd $(cat /tmp/sidle_path)'
```

and change directories as demonstrated below
